[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Versions-brightgreen)](https://github.com/YtDp4UDLc3gy26I/Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Project/releases)

## üìã Description

The Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Project offers a powerful solution for brain tumor segmentation. This application uses a PyTorch 2D U-Net model to help you clearly identify brain tumors in medical images. It supports FLAIR and T1CE modalities with advanced features like per-modality p99 normalization and a custom loss function that balances cross-entropy and soft Dice loss. With a focus on ease of use, this tool provides solid metrics and a built-in prediction visualizer to enhance your analysis.

## üìÇ Features

The Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Project offers several notable features:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple navigation to make the segmentation process straightforward.
- **Image Segmentation**: Efficiently processes both FLAIR and T1CE images.
- **Advanced Normalization**: Utilizes per-modality p99 normalization for better accuracy.
- **Loss Functions**: Implements a combination of cross-entropy and soft Dice loss for robust training performance.
- **Metrics and Visualizer**: Get reliable metrics from your analyses and visualize predictions for easier interpretation.

## üîß How to Use the Application

1. **Input Data**: Start by preparing your medical images in NIfTI format. Ensure they are organized and accessible from your system.
2. **Open Application**: Launch the application. You will see an option to upload your images.
3. **Upload Images**: Click the upload button and select the images you wish to analyze.
4. **Run Segmentation**: Once uploaded, click on ‚ÄúRun Segmentation.‚Äù Wait for the process to complete.
5. **View Results**: After processing, you will see visualized output along with statistical metrics related to the segmentation.

## üìñ Example Usage

For a more detailed understanding, consider a case where you analyze an MRI scan of a patient:

- **Load Image**: Open the application and load the patient‚Äôs FLAIR MRI scan.
- **Segment**: Click on ‚ÄúRun Segmentation.‚Äù The app identifies and marks tumor areas.
- **Review**: Examine the predictions using the built-in visualizer to see where the application detected tumors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider these steps:

- **Verify Compatibility**: Ensure your operating system and hardware meet the requirements listed above.
- **Check File Format**: Make sure all input files are in the correct NIfTI format.
- **Restart the Application**: If the application crashes, try closing and reopening it.
